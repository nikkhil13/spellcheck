# spellcheck
A Spell Checker in Python based on Peter Norvig's Guide.

This Spell Checker is based on this post by Peter Norvig http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html

You can visit http://nikkhil13.pythonanywhere.com to see this in action. 

This demo uses keypress event to detect the press of spacebar by the user which trigger the execution of spellcorrect function. Hence it'll not work on any android device as keypress event depends on Android version, keyboard apps being used and many other things. You can visit https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=118639 for more info.
